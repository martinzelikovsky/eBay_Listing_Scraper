Bulk eBay listing image exporter. 

Motivation: 
Bulk exporting seller listings on eBay does not export images from those listings. This project solves that problem. 

Function:
User inputs path to eBay Listing CSV export files outputted from eBay, inputs result folder title, and runs script. The result folder will contain a folder for each CSV file in the user inputted folder, and each of these folders will contain a folder for each listing with the corresponding listing images saved, as well as a copy of the listing CSV file with an added column containing the path towards each listing's images.
